* NVIDIA Tegra Secure Digital Host Controller

This controller on Tegra family SoCs provides an interface for MMC, SD,
and SDIO types of memory cards.

This file documents differences between the core properties described
by mmc.txt and the properties used by the sdhci-tegra driver.

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "nvidia,<chip>-sdhci"
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
=======
>>>>>>> v3.18
- clocks : Must contain one entry, for the module clock.
  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- resets : Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
  See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
- reset-names : Must include the following entries:
  - sdhci
<<<<<<< HEAD
>>>>>>> v3.18
=======
>>>>>>> v3.18

Optional properties:
- power-gpios : Specify GPIOs for power control

Example:

sdhci@c8000200 {
	compatible = "nvidia,tegra20-sdhci";
	reg = <0xc8000200 0x200>;
	interrupts = <47>;
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
	clocks = <&tegra_car 14>;
	resets = <&tegra_car 14>;
	reset-names = "sdhci";
>>>>>>> v3.18
=======
	clocks = <&tegra_car 14>;
	resets = <&tegra_car 14>;
	reset-names = "sdhci";
>>>>>>> v3.18
	cd-gpios = <&gpio 69 0>; /* gpio PI5 */
	wp-gpios = <&gpio 57 0>; /* gpio PH1 */
	power-gpios = <&gpio 155 0>; /* gpio PT3 */
	bus-width = <8>;
};
