Tegra SoC PWFM controller

Required properties:
- compatible: should be one of:
  - "nvidia,tegra20-pwm"
  - "nvidia,tegra30-pwm"
- reg: physical base address and length of the controller's registers
<<<<<<< HEAD
- #pwm-cells: On Tegra the number of cells used to specify a PWM is 2. The
  first cell specifies the per-chip index of the PWM to use and the second
  cell is the period in nanoseconds.
=======
- #pwm-cells: should be 2. See pwm.txt in this directory for a description of
  the cells format.
- clocks: Must contain one entry, for the module clock.
  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- resets: Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
  See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
- reset-names: Must include the following entries:
  - pwm
>>>>>>> v3.18

Example:

	pwm: pwm@7000a000 {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra20-pwm";
		reg = <0x7000a000 0x100>;
		#pwm-cells = <2>;
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
		clocks = <&tegra_car 17>;
		resets = <&tegra_car 17>;
		reset-names = "pwm";
>>>>>>> v3.18
	};
