* Samsung Exynos5440 Clock Controller

The Exynos5440 clock controller generates and supplies clock to various
controllers within the Exynos5440 SoC.

Required Properties:

<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
- comptible: should be "samsung,exynos5440-clock".

- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.

- #clock-cells: should be 1.

The following is the list of clocks generated by the controller. Each clock is
assigned an identifier and client nodes use this identifier to specify the
clock which they consume.

Each clock is assigned an identifier and client nodes can use this identifier
to specify the clock which they consume.

All available clocks are defined as preprocessor macros in
dt-bindings/clock/exynos5440.h header and can be used in device
tree sources.

Example: An example of a clock controller node is listed below.

	clock: clock-controller@0x10010000 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos5440-clock";
		reg = <0x160000 0x10000>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
	};
