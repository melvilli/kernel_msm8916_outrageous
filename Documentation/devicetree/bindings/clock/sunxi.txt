Required properties for all clocks:
- reg : shall be the control register address for the clock.
- clocks : shall be the input parent clock(s) phandle for the clock. For
	multiplexed clocks, the list order must match the hardware
	programming order.
- #clock-cells : from common clock binding; shall be set to 0 except for
	"allwinner,*-gates-clk", "allwinner,sun4i-pll5-clk" and
	"allwinner,sun4i-pll6-clk" where it shall be set to 1
- clock-output-names : shall be the corresponding names of the outputs.
	If the clock module only has one output, the name shall be the
	module name.

And "allwinner,*-usb-clk" clocks also require:
- reset-cells : shall be set to 1

For "allwinner,sun7i-a20-gmac-clk", the parent clocks shall be fixed rate
dummy clocks at 25 MHz and 125 MHz, respectively. See example.

Clock consumers should specify the desired clocks they use with a
"clocks" phandle cell. Consumers that are using a gated clock should
provide an additional ID in their clock property. This ID is the
offset of the bit controlling this particular gate in the register.

For example:

osc24M: clk@01c20050 {
	#clock-cells = <0>;
	compatible = "allwinner,sun4i-a10-osc-clk";
	reg = <0x01c20050 0x4>;
	clocks = <&osc24M_fixed>;
	clock-output-names = "osc24M";
};

pll1: clk@01c20000 {
	#clock-cells = <0>;
	compatible = "allwinner,sun4i-a10-pll1-clk";
	reg = <0x01c20000 0x4>;
	clocks = <&osc24M>;
	clock-output-names = "pll1";
};

pll5: clk@01c20020 {
	#clock-cells = <1>;
	compatible = "allwinner,sun4i-pll5-clk";
	reg = <0x01c20020 0x4>;
	clocks = <&osc24M>;
	clock-output-names = "pll5_ddr", "pll5_other";
>>>>>>> v3.18
};

cpu: cpu@01c20054 {
	#clock-cells = <0>;
<<<<<<< HEAD
	compatible = "allwinner,sun4i-cpu-clk";
	reg = <0x01c20054 0x4>;
	clocks = <&osc32k>, <&osc24M>, <&pll1>;
};
