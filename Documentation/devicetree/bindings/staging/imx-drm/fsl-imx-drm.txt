Freescale i.MX DRM master device
================================

The freescale i.MX DRM master device is a virtual device needed to list all
IPU or other display interface nodes that comprise the graphics subsystem.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "fsl,imx-display-subsystem"
- ports: Should contain a list of phandles pointing to display interface ports
  of IPU devices

example:

display-subsystem {
	compatible = "fsl,display-subsystem";
	ports = <&ipu_di0>;
};


>>>>>>> v3.18
Freescale i.MX IPUv3
====================

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "fsl,<chip>-ipu"
- reg: should be register base and length as documented in the
  datasheet
- interrupts: Should contain sync interrupt and error interrupt,
  in this order.
<<<<<<< HEAD
- #crtc-cells: 1, See below
- resets: phandle pointing to the system reset controller and
          reset line index, see reset/fsl,imx-src.txt for details

          reset line index, see reset/fsl,imx-src.txt for details
Optional properties:
- port@[0-3]: Port nodes with endpoint definitions as defined in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.
  Ports 0 and 1 should correspond to CSI0 and CSI1,
  ports 2 and 3 should correspond to DI0 and DI1, respectively.

example:

ipu: ipu@18000000 {

Parallel display support
========================

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "fsl,imx-parallel-display"
<<<<<<< HEAD
- crtc: the crtc this display is connected to, see below
Optional properties:
- interface_pix_fmt: How this display is connected to the
  crtc. Currently supported types: "rgb24", "rgb565", "bgr666"
- edid: verbatim EDID data block describing attached display.
- ddc: phandle describing the i2c bus handling the display data
  channel
