	  This module adds core support for wireless adapters based on
	  Atheros AR6003 and AR6004 chipsets. You still need separate
	  bus drivers for USB and SDIO to be able to use real devices.

	  If you choose to build it as a module, it will be called
	  ath6kl_core. Please note that AR6002 and AR6001 are not
	  supported by this driver.
